Version 1.000.08
February 14, 2006

Added "-barrier" option to mpi_io_test.c. This required adding 2 more arguments to function collect_and_print_time. They are "double barrier_wait_time" and "int barrier_flag". Also added the latter argument to print_input_environment and show_usage. Made function defs in print.h consistent with these changes. Made changes to the routines below consistent with the description above.

Version 1.000.07
September 16, 2005

Replaced old copyright with the BSD copyright notice. The
MPI-IO test is now open source.

Version 1.000.06
September 7, 2005

Removed -seek option; this was an abuse of the
MPI_File_set_view routine.
